here's an example implementation of the App component with the two Product components displaying the required data

In the example above, we've imported the <Product /> component from the "Product.js" file and used it twice in the App component. We've passed the required data (title, price, and description) to each Product component via props.

The Product component can then access this data via the props object and display it in the component's output. Here's an example implementation of the Product component that uses the passed-in props.

In this implementation, we've used the passed-in props to display the title, price, and description of the product. The output is wrapped in a <div> element for styling purposes.

Note that we've also used the curly braces syntax to output the price as a JavaScript expression. This allows us to dynamically output the price value that was passed in via props.
